	<h2>Burgers: A Tasty College Metaphor</h2>

			McChickens in Taiwan are healthier. I didn't do any Googling this time; I could taste it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Taiwanese McChickens use a different chicken patty, which is less crunchy and also less oily.  They also have less than a quarter of the sodium. However, in spite of these healthy benefits, to an American McChicken lover like me, they taste more like McFishes.
			Maybe people are like burgers.  Not physically, because we definitely aren't hearty patties enveloped by soft, sweet buns, but maybe mentally.  We're more like a juxtaposition of various flavors from our past experiences, seasoned with ideas and knowledge, then cushioned with bread for refinement.
		</p>
		<p>
			So what kind of burgers are we?
		</p>
		<p>
			There surely isn't any individual sandwich that can describe us perfectly.  There aren't tricks to instantly determine one's "burger standing" accurately.  Quick!  Do I seem like a Whopper or Filet-o-Fish?  I can't even decide--my compassion emulates the tenderness of a Filet, but my confidence (and occasional arrogance) show the balls of a Mac.  Ultimately, trying to define one's burger ranking requires a lot more ingredients--like building a custom burger from scratch.

			There's a burger restaurant in my hometown Fremont called The Habit, where servers create burgers made-to-order.  Not surprisingly, due to its extensive customization program, it's my favorite burger place--I'm able to create burgers of my own liking, to alter a few details and end up with new, thrilling combinations.  Yet there are always better and worse combinations, even by just altering an ingredient.  That's the most interesting thing about both burgers and people--that we are changed by the slightest change in ingredients, be it mayo instead of ketchup, badminton instead of tennis, or even UChicago instead of some other college--those are the things, while seemingly insignificant, that ultimately create the largest differences. And knowing this, I intend to create myself by only selecting the best ingredients.  But nonetheless, we dine on burgers, not on separate meat patties, cheese, and bread.  Likewise, only by combining important attributes: passion, dedication, and imagination, can one be the most successful (burger) in life.  And the most important thing is to effectively mix all the ingredients.

			People are like burgers.
		</p>
		<p>
			I've found my breaded chicken patty, my iceberg lettuce, my creamy mayonnaise.  Now nurture me, sear my meat in your intellectual oven.  Crown me with two perfect golden buns.  Pamper me to perfection.
		</p>
		<p>
			Let me be your burger.
