			I watched as the veteran trudged on the dull olive carpet.
		</p>
		<p>
			“Donations are appreciated,” he spoke softly.  His back bent at an angle unusual for his age; he seemed only forty, yet his back had already bent forty degrees external.  His eyes glared hopefully at each member of BART Train Car 3 en route to Fremont.  
		</p>
		<p>
			“Donations are appreciated.  Any food?”
		</p>
		<p>
			I let him pass by, slowly, glancing only out of the corners of my eyes.  I wondered why folks begged on Bart.  Did they not have to buy a ticket?  Did they board thinking that more help would be found with us commuters?
		</p>
		<p>
			The gum felt heavy in my pocket.  I remembered it.
		</p>
		<p>
			The veteran was halfway to the next car.  I didn’t stand up.  Maybe I stayed due to the bystander principle; maybe I didn’t.  I watched as he passed each person, giving each a hopeful stare.  None were returned.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>He can’t want gum, </i>I thought.  <i>That’s the silliest thing to give him.  Would he even have wanted gum?</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			Doors opened, and the harsh screech of metal on rails shoved me from my thoughts.  The veteran stepped into the next car, and initiated his ritual again.
		</p>
		<p>
			The question repeated itself in my mind.  <i>Would he even have wanted gum?</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>I guess I’ll never find out anyways.</i>
